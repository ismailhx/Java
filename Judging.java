 * I am part of a team working on a voting system for a tv

store basic details about the votes of a panel of judges for the performance by a 
single participant on a show. Each instance of this class with hold details of just one 
participant so other parts of the (imaginary) team will write the code to store multiple 
instances â€“ one for each participant
